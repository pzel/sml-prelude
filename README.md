# MLton Prelude

The aim of this project is to have a one-stop shop for common utilities as
defined by the MLton authors

 - http://www.mlton.org/Utilities
 - http://www.mlton.org/InfixingOperators

available in one place that's accessible via the [smlpkg package
manager](https://github.com/diku-dk/smlpkg).

This prelude can be used with PolyML thanks to the fantastic [polymlb
project](https://github.com/vqns/polymlb).
